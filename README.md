## Project 3: Data Visuzalization for Neflix Data

In the following project, we were evaluating data from netflix based on their distribution of content per year, genre, and country. Based on the data, we were able to identify the trends of content for Netflix. Television shows seems to not have longitivity in terms of seasons. Using this data allowed me to develop skills in data vizualization in Python using the following libaries: bumpy, pandas, bokeh, json, pylab, geopandas, holoviews.
